# 🚗 Auto Price Prediction using Neural Networks and ONNX

This project predicts automobile prices based on technical and categorical attributes from the UCI “Automobile” dataset.  
It trains multiple neural network architectures and a Random Forest model, compares their performance, and deploys the best model using **ONNX** on **GitHub Pages** for browser-based inference.

## 🧩 Features
- Data preprocessing (imputation, scaling, one-hot encoding)
- Three neural network architectures: SimpleNN, DeepNN, WideNN
- Random Forest model for comparison
- R² score and loss visualization
- Export to **ONNX** format
- Browser-based demo using **ONNX Runtime Web**

# 💼 Adult Income Classification using XGBoost and ONNX

This project classifies whether an individual earns more than $50K per year using demographic information from the UCI Adult dataset.  
The model is trained with **XGBoost**, evaluated with multiple metrics, and deployed using **ONNX Runtime Web** for browser predictions.
